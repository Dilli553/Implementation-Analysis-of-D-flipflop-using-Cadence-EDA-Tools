# Ex No: 03 - Implementation & Analysis of D Flip-Flop using Cadence EDA Tools
# Aim
The aim is to design, implement, and analyze a D flip-flop using Cadence EDA tools, ensuring accurate sequential logic operation through waveform analysis and performance verification.

# Tools Required
## Cadence EDA Suite
Virtuoso Schematic Editor (for circuit design)
Spectre Simulator (for circuit simulation)
## Process Design Kit (PDK)
CMOS technology library (e.g., 180nm, 45nm node)
## Computer System
Minimum 4GB RAM and a multi-core processor
# Procedure
## 1. Launch Cadence Virtuoso Environment
Open the Cadence Virtuoso tool and set up the working library.
Create a new schematic cell view for the D flip-flop design.
## 2. Schematic Design
Select NMOS and PMOS transistors from the library.
Design the D flip-flop circuit with key components such as clock signal input, D input, and Q output.
Implement feedback connections to enable sequential behavior.
Connect appropriate voltage sources for logic control and supply.
## 3. Simulation
Verify the schematic design for connection errors.
Launch the Analog Design Environment (ADE).
Configure transient analysis to observe timing behavior and output transitions.
Set simulation parameters such as clock frequency, voltage levels, and delay conditions.
Use Spectre simulator to perform transient analysis and functional verification.
## 4. Waveform Analysis
Observe the output waveform to confirm correct D flip-flop functionality.
Ensure that the Q output follows the D input on the rising edge of the clock signal.
